## üéâ v1.0.0 Stable Release Available

WP Block to HTML v1.0.0 is now live on NPM! Install it today and start building faster headless WordPress applications.

```bash
npm install wp-block-to-html
```

## What is WP Block to HTML?

WP Block to HTML is a production-ready JavaScript library that converts WordPress block data into clean, framework-agnostic HTML. It bridges the gap between WordPress as a content management system and modern frontend applications built with frameworks like React, Vue, Next.js, or any other technology.

```javascript
import { convertBlocks } from 'wp-block-to-html';

// WordPress blocks data
const blocks = [
  {
    blockName: 'core/paragraph',
    attrs: { content: 'Hello World', align: 'center' },
    innerBlocks: []
  }
];

// Convert to HTML
const html = convertBlocks(blocks);
console.log(html); // <p class="has-text-align-center">Hello World</p>
```

## New in v1.0.0: Client-Side Hydration

The first stable release introduces powerful client-side hydration capabilities for SSR scenarios:

```javascript
import { HydrationManager } from 'wp-block-to-html/hydration';

// Progressive hydration with multiple strategies
const hydrationManager = new HydrationManager({
  strategy: 'viewport', // viewport, interaction, idle, immediate
  rootSelector: '#app'
});

// Hydrate specific blocks
await hydrationManager.hydrateBlock('block-id-123');

// Batch hydration
await hydrationManager.hydrateAll();
```

## Key Features

### Framework Integration

Easily integrate with popular JavaScript frameworks:

```javascript
// React Integration
import { createReactComponent } from 'wp-block-to-html/react';
const BlockComponent = createReactComponent(blocks, {
  cssFramework: 'tailwind',
  hydration: { strategy: 'viewport' }
});

// Vue Integration
import { createVueComponent } from 'wp-block-to-html/vue';
const BlockComponent = createVueComponent(blocks, {
  cssFramework: 'bootstrap',
  hydration: { strategy: 'interaction' }
});
```

### CSS Framework Support

Generate HTML with classes from your preferred CSS framework:

```javascript
// Using Tailwind CSS
const html = convertBlocks(blocks, {
  cssFramework: 'tailwind'
});

// Using Bootstrap
const html = convertBlocks(blocks, {
  cssFramework: 'bootstrap'
});

// Using custom class mappings
const html = convertBlocks(blocks, {
  cssFramework: 'custom',
  customClassMap
});
```

### Server-Side Rendering Optimizations

Optimize your content for better performance metrics:

```javascript
// Apply SSR optimizations
const html = convertBlocks(blocks, {
  ssrOptions: {
    enabled: true,
    optimizationLevel: 'maximum',
    lazyLoadMedia: true
  },
  hydration: {
    strategy: 'progressive',
    priorityBlocks: ['core/button', 'core/gallery']
  }
});
```
